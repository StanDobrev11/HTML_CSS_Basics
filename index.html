<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>The TITLE is the title of the tab of the browser, the BODY contains the plain text.
    The Headings only differs by font size. It is good to have h1 only once per page. The paragraph
    contains plain text. Form tag describes a FORM. STRONG == BOLD, EM == ITALIC. A-TAG is a hyperlink
    to another webpage or. IMG-TAG for photos. Does not have closing TAG. INPUT and IMG tags are
    self-closing tags. You should use picture URL address by default. To use photo stored on PC,
    "./" - current directory. Tags element have attributes. Attributes have KEY="VALUE" and are
    always placed in the opening tags. In the head-line you can place script to be executed upon
    opening the webpage. You can define different styles of the body for example. The META tag
    provides info so the browser works better - define words for search engine etc. STYLESHEET is CSS
    as a separate file included in the HTML which defines color, font etc. Look for HTML validator in
    order to check what you have written.
    CSS is visual presentation of HTML doc
